# Okato Nekomato | Hello there! 👋

I'm Okato Nekomato, a developer who believes in creating cool things without all the fuss. Currently, I'm immersed in two exciting projects: my very first management simulator, where I'm bringing my gameplay ideas to life, and a new messenger app that I hope will make communication a little easier and more enjoyable. In my free time, I love to dig into the code of my favorite games, creating mods that make them even better.

I'm always open to meeting new people and collaborating on interesting projects. Feel free to get in touch!
